These files include the orbits being used in MAF simulations. 

The full original populations are included, as well as the subset (typically 5k) used 
in current simulations. These 5k will include an assigned SED, if one was not previously available.
The 5k objects are cloned over an appropriate H range to evaluate metric results.
